### Overview

Stereo reconstruction models trained on small images do not generalize well to high-resolution data. Training a model on high-resolution image size faces difficulties of data availability and is often infeasible due to limited computing resources. In this work, we present the Occlusion-aware Recurrent binocular Stereo matching (ORStereo), which deals with these issues by only training on available low disparity range stereo images. ORStereo generalizes to unseen high-resolution images with large disparity ranges by formulating the task as residual updates and refinements of an initial prediction. ORStereo is trained on images with disparity ranges limited to 256 pixels, yet it can operate 4K-resolution input with over 1000 disparities using limited GPU memory. We test the model's capability on both synthetic and real-world high-resolution images. Experimental results demonstrate that ORStereo achieves comparable performance on 4K-resolution images compared to state-of-the-art methods trained on large disparity ranges. Compared to other methods that are only trained on low-resolution images, our method is 70% more accurate on 4K-resolution images.

### 4K-resolution stereo dataset

We collected a set of 4K-resolution stereo images for evaluating ORStereo's performance on high-resolution data. These images and ground truth data will be made publicly available. The images are collected in various simulated environments rendered by the Unreal Engine and the AirSim plugin. 100 pairs of photo-realistic stereo images from 7 indoor and outdoor scenes are collected. We set up a virtual stereo camera with a baseline of 0.38m. In 3 of the 7 scenes, the cameras have a horizontal viewing angle of 46 degrees. For the remaining 4 scenes, the horizontal viewing angle is 60 degrees. The image size of the virtual camera is 4112x3008 pixels. These camera parameters are selected to match the real-world sensor that we are using for data collection. The AirSim plugin provides us with a depth image for every captured RGB image. We compute the true disparities and occlusion masks from the depth images.

 <figcaption>Samples of the collected 4K-resolution images. The columns are the individual environments and there are 3 samples for each. The even-number rows are the disparities with occlusion. The 7 environments have different themes. From left to right: factory district, artistic architecture, indoor restaurant, underground work zone, indoor supermarket, train station, and city ruins. The first 3 columns are from the virtual camera with 46 degrees of horizontal viewing angle. The other 4 columns are from the 60 degrees camera.</figcaption>

The following figure shows another pair of the collected stereo images in detail. Note that all disparities and occlusion masks are associated with the left image.

 <figcaption>A detailed sample from the collected 4K-resolution stereo images. From left to right: the left image, right image, disparity, and occlusion mask. The disparity is computed from the depth provided by AirSim. The occlusion mask is obtained by comparing the depth images from both the cameras with exact extrinsic parameters.</figcaption>

### Access the 4K-resolution dataset

All of the stereo images, together with the true disparity and occlusion mask are available [here](https://cmu.box.com/s/eepyd7fpjzwdjqlz3507wxbzec50cd8i).

Concerning the large file size of a 4K-resolution floating point image, we save the disparity as compressed PNG files in RGBA format. We provide a simple Python function to read the floating point disparity back from those PNG files. Access the code [here](https://github.com/castacks/iros_2021_orstereo).

When working on low-resolution inputs such as the Scene Flow dataset, ORStereo only goes through the first phase. Two sample results are shown as follows.
