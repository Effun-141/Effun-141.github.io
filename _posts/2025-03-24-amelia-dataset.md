Amelia-48 is a large-scale airport surface movement dataset collected using the System Wide Information Management (SWIM) Surface Movement Event Service (SMES). With data collection beginning in December 2022, the dataset is continuously expanding, with ~30TB of new data added annually. It covers surface movement events across 48 airports and TRACON facilities within the US National Airspace System.
