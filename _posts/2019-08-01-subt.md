### What is the Subterranean (SubT) Challenge?
As stated on the [DARPA SubT page](https://www.darpa.mil/program/darpa-subterranean-challenge):
>
The DARPA Subterranean (SubT) Challenge aims to develop innovative technologies that would augment operations underground. The SubT Challenge will explore new approaches to rapidly map, navigate, search, and exploit complex underground environments, including human-made tunnel systems, urban underground, and natural cave networks.
>
Teams will compete in three preliminary Circuit events and a Final event pursuing high-risk and high-reward approaches. The Final event, planned for 2021, will put teams to the test with courses that incorporate diverse challenges from all three environments.

Team Explorer is a partnership between labs from Carnegie Mellon University and Oregon State University.
