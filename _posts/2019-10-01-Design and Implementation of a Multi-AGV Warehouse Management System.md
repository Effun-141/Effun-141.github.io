## Introduction

#### &#127774; Aims: 

1. 
2. 
3. 

#### &#128221; Advisor: Prof. Yifei Wu 

#### &#128197; Duration: Oct. 2019 - May. 2020

## Contributions

1. Designed precise wheeled odometry control for accurate robot localization.
2. Implemented A* algorithm for path planning; used PID for motor closed-loop and robot line-following control.
3. Independently completed hardware design and assembly of 3 model AGVs; developed and integrated embedded software for all modules.


## Conclusion

The designed multi-AGV system operates efficiently on the simulated map. Each AGV can plan a path to the target point, follow the planned path to the designated location, and dynamically avoid other AGVs in real-time based on priority during operation. Additionally, each AGV can communicate with the central control system.

## Outcomes
 
1. Two software copyright; 
2. A complete multi-AGV system
