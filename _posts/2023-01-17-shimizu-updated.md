During a 4-year research collaboration with an international corporation in civil engineering ([Shimizu Institute of Technology](https://www.shimz.co.jp/en/company/about/sit/)), people in the AirLab built several specialized sensor components and robots to explore the possibilities of applying our knowledge and skills to the commonwealth of the general public.

With the target of enabling automated infrastructure inspection for structures such as buildings and bridges, we developed a series of sensor payload and drone systems that are able to automatically collect multi-model data, with an offline reconstruction system that utilizes the data collected to reconstruct the dense 3D model of the structure with geometric details and colored textures. The reconstructed data can be utilized for inspection purposes such as surface defect detection and quantification. They can also be further processed into 3D geometries that are suitable for scientific and engineering computation and analysis, e.g. structural safety analysis.

To fulfill the infrastructure inspection requirements, the sensor components and the robot platform need to deliver some important features:
- Sub-millimeter 3D reconstruction for better defect quantification.
- Computer-aided inspection capability for working with human inspectors.
- Automatic defect detection in images.
- Reconstruction of the inspected target for computer-aided engineering such as Finite Element Method (FEM) computations of structural safety analysis.

There are several challenges we have addressed:
- Extremely dense 3D reconstruction.
- Stereo Structure-from-Motion (SfM).
- High-resolution binocular stereo vision.
- Robust robot state estimation.
- Abstract mapping for lightweight localization.

Some highlights of our reconstruction results from real-world data.

## Data processing ##

Due to the sheer amount of data we need to handle, many of the data processing procedures are facilitated by automatic scripts and run on remote servers.

__Data extraction and pre-processing.__
Images and point clouds are extracted from a large amount of raw data and preprocessed by leveraging the multi-core structure of the remote server. Parallel computing is applied whenever we can. 

__Large-scale 3D reconstruction.__
We have a set of dedicated programs and scripts to process the collected data and perform large-scale 3D reconstruction on HPCs. Similar to pre-processing, we try to leverage the multi-core architectures on the remote server to accelerate the process. This allows us to do reconstructions with billions of 3D points.


__Meshing.__
Customized program for automatically converting a point cloud to a surface mesh. Automatically, fill the holes in the surface mesh. The following is an example where we scanned a concrete beam specimen and reconstructed a dense point cloud of it. Then a surface mesh is generated with hole-filling.

__Thermal-mapping.__
With the reconstructed dense 3D point cloud based on RGB images, we can project the thermal image to the point cloud. Special treatments are applied to smooth the intensity values of the thermal images to have temporal-consistent thermal pixel values.

# Research #

Apart from the engineering efforts, we also identified several research topics and pushed the relevant state-of-the-art toward more accurate, efficient, and robust algorithms. 

## Stereo & LiDAR-enhanced SfM ##
We developed new algorithms by introducing stereo image constrain and LiDAR information to Structure-from-Motion (SfM). By doing this, the SfM becomes much more robust to noise and mismatches and the reconstructed point clouds have the correct scale.
