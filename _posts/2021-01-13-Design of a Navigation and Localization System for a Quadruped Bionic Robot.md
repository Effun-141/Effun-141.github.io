1. 
2. 
3. 


#### &#128221; Advisor: Prof. Yifei Wu 

#### &#128197; Duration: Jan. 2021 - Jun. 2021

## Contributions

1. Learned visual SLAM fundamental theories and ORB-SLAM2 source code.
2. Reproduced ORB-SLAM2 for indoor/outdoor high-precision localization using TUM dataset and D435i camera.
3. Developed dense point cloud and octree mapping programs using ROS, OpenCV, and PCL for environment perception and navigation.

## Conclusion

1. Concluded that the designed navigation and localization system can achieve indoor localization accuracy of less than 5cm and outdoor accuracy of less than 0.3m.
2. Produced the point cloud map and the octree map.


## Outcomes
 
An undergraduate thesis that won the second prize for excellent graduation design in Jiangsu Province.
