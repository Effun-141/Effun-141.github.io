3. 


#### &#128221; Advisor: Prof. Yifei Wu 

#### &#128197; Duration: Jan. 2021 - Jun. 2021

## Contributions

1. Learned visual SLAM fundamental theories and ORB-SLAM2 source code.
2. Reproduced ORB-SLAM2 for indoor/outdoor high-precision localization using TUM dataset and D435i camera.
3. Developed dense point cloud and octree mapping programs using ROS, OpenCV, and PCL for environment perception and navigation.

## Conclusion

1. Concluded that the designed navigation and localization system can achieve indoor localization accuracy of less than 5cm and outdoor accuracy of less than 0.3m.
2. 

The real-time indoor positioning accuracy of the robot is 5cm, and the real-time outdoor positioning accuracy is 0.5m, and the point cloud map and the octree map which serves the navigation have been established.
