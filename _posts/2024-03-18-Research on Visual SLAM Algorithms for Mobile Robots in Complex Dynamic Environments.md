## Introduction

#### &#127774; Aims: 

1. Addressing the impact of highly dynamic objects on SLAM system performance.
2. Solving the problem of unknown dynamic object recognition when semantic segmentation network fails.
3. Overcoming the limitation of SLAM systems in generating dense point cloud maps under dynamic scenes.
