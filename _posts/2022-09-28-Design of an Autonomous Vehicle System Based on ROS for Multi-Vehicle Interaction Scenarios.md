## Introduction

#### &#127774; Aims: 

1. The main goal of this project is to design a versatile unmanned vehicle experimental platform that can be used for the development and validation of algorithms such as SLAM, path planning, and object detection.
2. We used the designed unmanned vehicle platform to participate in the *13th Jiangsu Provincial Robotics Competition's multi-drone interaction project*. The competition simulates autonomous vehicles driving on roads, involving tasks such as straight-line driving, overtaking, lane changing, and parking.
3. It was also the final project for a course called 'Comprehensive Embedded Systems Experiment' during my master's studies. 
   

#### &#128221; Advisor: Prof. Yifei Wu 

#### &#128197; Duration: Oct. 2023 - Nov. 2023

## Contributions

1. Proposed a dual-loop localization and obstacle avoidance algorithm based on LiDAR data for angle and position control, enabling the autonomous vehicle to drive in the center of a simulated road and interact with multiple vehicles.
2. Designed a communication program between the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and the lower-level control board based on ROS; integrated all algorithms into ROS packages to improve development efficiency.
3. Independently completed the full assembly of the mobile robot.


## Outcomes
 
A complete and versatile development platform for unmanned vehicles.

A course report that received a score of 93, ranking 1/114 in the class.
