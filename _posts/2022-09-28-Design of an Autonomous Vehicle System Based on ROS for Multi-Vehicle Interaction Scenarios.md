## Contributions

1. Proposed a dual-loop localization and obstacle avoidance algorithm based on LiDAR data for angle and position control, enabling the autonomous vehicle to drive in the center of a simulated road and interact with multiple vehicles.
2. Designed a communication program between the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and the lower-level control board based on ROS; integrated all algorithms into ROS packages to improve development efficiency.
3. Independently completed the full assembly of the mobile robot.


## Outcomes
 
A complete and versatile development platform for unmanned vehicles.
