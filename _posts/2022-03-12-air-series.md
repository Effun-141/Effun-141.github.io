### Contribution


* **AirDet: Few-shot Detection without Fine-tunning**

   * The first practical few-shot object detection method that requires no fine-tunning.
   * It achieves even better results than the exhaustively fine-tuned methods (up to 60% improvements).
   * Validated on real world sequences from DARPA Subterranean (SubT) challenge.

* **AirObject: Temporal Object Embedding**

   * The first temporal object embedding method.
   * It achieves the state-of-the-art performance for video object identification.
   * Robust to severe occlusion, perceptual aliasing, viewpoint shift, deformation, and scale transform.

* **AirDOS: Dynamic Object-aware SLAM (DOS) system**

   * The first DOS system showing that camera pose estimation can be improved by incorporating dynamic articulated objects.
   * Establish 4-D dynamic object maps.

* **AirLoop: Lifelong Learning for Robots**

   * The first lifelong learning method for loop closure detection.
   * Model incremental improvement even after deployment.

* **AirCode: Robust Object Encoding**

   * The first deep point-based object encoding for single image.
   * It achieves the state-of-the-art performance for object re-identification.
   * Robust to viewpoint shift, object deformation, and scale transform.
