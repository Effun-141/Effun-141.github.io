 Dynamic Object-aware SLAM (DOS) exploits
object-level information to enable robust motion estimation in
dynamic environments. It has attracted increasing attention
with the recent success of learning-based models. Existing
methods mainly focus on identifying and excluding dynamic
objects from the optimization. In this paper, we show that
feature-based visual SLAM systems can also benefit from the
presence of dynamic articulated objects by taking advantage of
two observations: 
* The 3D structure of an articulated object
remains consistent over time; 
* The points on the same object
follow the same motion.

 In particular, we present **AirDOS**,
a dynamic object-aware system that introduces rigidity and
motion constraints to model articulated objects. By jointly
optimizing the camera pose, object motion, and the object 3D
structure, we can rectify the camera pose estimation, preventing
tracking lost, and generate 4D spatio-temporal maps for both
dynamic objects and static scenes. 

## Articulated Objects

In this paper, we extend the simple rigid objects to general articulated objects, defined as
objects composed of one or more rigid parts (links) connected by joints allowing rotational or
translational motion, e.g., vehicles and humans, and utilize the properties of
articulated objects to improve the camera pose estimation. Namely, we jointly optimize the
3D structural information and the motion of articulated objects. To this end, we introduce (1)
a **rigidity constraint**, which assumes that the distance between any two points located on the
same rigid part remains constant over time, and (2) a **motion constraint**, which assumes that
feature points on the same rigid parts follow the same 3D motion. This allows us to build a 4D
spatio-temporal map including both dynamic and static structures.

environment, we can model rigid objects like vehicle and semi-rigid objects like pedestrian as articulated
object.
