# Biography
Hi &#128522;! I am a third-year postgradute student at School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST, 211 project).
My major is Control Science and Engineering, and my research focuses on mobile robot localization and scene understanding.

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Automation at Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST) in June 2021, as a member of Robotics Innovation Lab (Auto-Robot). 


<br/>

# Research Interests
I hope to enhance the intelligence of robots, enabling them to perceive and understand the world like humans do, so that they can be truly applied in human life and work collaboratively with people in the future. 

To realize my academic goals, my research interests focus on:

* **Visul SLAM in dynamic scene**
* **Robot environment perception and understanding**
* **Multi-robot collaborative SLAM**

# Project Experience

Here are projects I participated in during my undergraduate and master's studies. More details and outcomes of all these projects are shown in [*Portfolio*](https://effun.xyz/portfolio/) page.

During my master’s and undergraduate studies, I participated in the following **projects closely related to my research interests**. These projects involved **visual SLAM, laser SLAM, and the Robot Operating System (ROS)**:

1. Research on Visual SLAM Algorithms for Mobile Robots in Complex Dynamic Environments. (2024.02 ~ present)
2. Design of a Navigation and Positioning System for an Autonomous Harvesting Robot in a Simulated Farmland Environment. (2023.05 ~ 2023.06)
3. Design of a Laser SLAM System Based on LeGO-LOAM
4. Design of an Autonomous Vehicle System Based on ROS for Multi-Vehicle Interaction Scenarios. (2022.09 ~ 2022.11)
5. Design of a Navigation and Positioning System for a Quadruped Bionic Robot. (2021.01 ~ 2021.06)

Additionally, I have participated in the following projects, which required not only **theoretical or engineering design** but also the **writing of related project proposals, patents, and theses**:：

1. Research on Integrated Methods for Scene Understanding and Knowledge Acquisition and Reasoning in Earth-Moon Space Based on Generative Models. (2023.09 ~ present)
2. Design of a Control System for a Wheeled-Legged Amphibious Robot Based on Super-Helical Sliding Mode Control. (2023.02 ~ 2023.03)
3. Design and Implementation of a Multi-AGV Warehouse Management System. (2019.10 ~ 2020.05)

During my undergraduate studies, I also participated in the following **competition-related projects**:

1. Design of an Intelligent Car Based on Visual Guidance. (2019.03 ~ 2019.07)
2. Design of an Electromagnetic Railgun Based on Visual Guidance. (2019.08 ~ 2019.10)
3. Design of a Vehicle-Type Exploration and Cruising Robot. (2019.10 ~ 2019.12)
