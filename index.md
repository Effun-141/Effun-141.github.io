# &#11088; Biography

Hi &#128522;! I am a Research Assistant at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, ShenZhen, advised by Prof. [Junfeng Wu](https://lias-cuhksz.github.io/group/junfeng-wu) and Prof. [Ziyang Hong](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/teacher/1865). 
My major is Control Science and Engineering, and my research focuses on SLAM and robotics.

I received my Master's degree in Control Science and Engineering in April 2025 and Bachelor’s degree in Automation in June 2021 at Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST, 211 project) , as a member of Robotics Innovation Lab (Auto-Robot).

# &#128640; Research Interests

My research interests focus on:

* **Event camera-based Visual SLAM in underwater scene**
* **Deep Learning-based Visual SLAM in dynamic scene**
* **Robot environment perception and understanding**
* **Multi-robot collaborative SLAM**

Currently, SLAM remains a fundamental task in robotics. In the future, I hope to focus on the **integration of deep learning techniques (such as generative models and semantic segmentation, etc.) with robotics SLAM**, enabling them to perceive and understand the world like humans do, so that they can be truly applied in human life and work collaboratively with people in the future. 

My academic belief and pursuit can be seen in [*Belief & Pursuit*](https://effun.xyz/2014-07-18/Story) page.
