# &#11088; Biography
Hi &#128522;! I am a third-year postgradute student at School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST, 211 project).
My major is Control Science and Engineering, and my research focuses on mobile robot localization and scene understanding.

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Automation at Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST) in June 2021, as a member of Robotics Innovation Lab (Auto-Robot). 

Academic performance:

* Master's: Average score: 91.48/100，ranked 11/390 (top 3%).
* Bachelor's: GPA 3.42/4, ranked 56/188 (top 30%).

<br/>

# &#128640; Research Interests
I hope to enhance the intelligence of robots, enabling them to perceive and understand the world like humans do, so that they can be truly applied in human life and work collaboratively with people in the future. 

To realize my academic goals, my research interests focus on:

* **Visul SLAM in dynamic scene**
* **Robot environment perception and understanding**
* **Multi-robot collaborative SLAM**
