Viktor is postdoctoral fellow at the AirLab.
He obtained his PhD (Biocybernetics and Artificial Intelligence) from Czech Technical University in Prague, supervised by Dr. Martin Saska.
His research interests are relative localization of robots, computer vision, aerial robots, multi-robot systems, swarms and  formation flight.
One of his primary results during his PhD studies was the development of the UVDAR (UltraViolet Direction and Ranging) system for mutual relative localization of UAVs in outdoor conditions.
Viktor likes to work with robots in the field, and previously participated in the MBZIRC 2020 competition, in a  team that scored the overall victory.
