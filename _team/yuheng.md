Yuheng Qiu is a Ph.D. candidate at Carnegie Mellon University advised by [Sebastian Scherer](https://theairlab.org/team/sebastian/), as a part of the AirLab. I have an innate passion for advancing spatial AI to enhance robot autonomy.

One specific area I focus on is creating generalized learning-based SLAM systems. Currently, engineers need to manually tune hyperparameters when applying these systems to new platforms, datasets, or sensors. I believe data-driven methods and uncertainty modeling are key to solving this problem. I hope that one day, SLAM will be fully automatedâ€”so much so that SLAM engineers like me will become unnecessary. (And I'll happily "fire" myself when that day comes! ðŸ˜‚)

I received a B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-SZ) in 2019.
