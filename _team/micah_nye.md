Micah is a Master's student in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University. Currently, Micah is investigating learned vehicle dynamics models to maximize handling at the limit for off-road autonomous vehicles navigating in uncertain, unstructured environments. He is interested in exploiting unconventional sensor data to improve control models and planning policies.

Previously, Micah has worked on adversarial planning and localization on robots traveling 150mph+ for his autonomous racing team, [MIT-PITT-RW](https://www.mitpittrw.com/). Micah graduated from the University of Pittsburgh, with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering.

In his free time, he loves watching movies, listening to records, hiking, and playing video games.
