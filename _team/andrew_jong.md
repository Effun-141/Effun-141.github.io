Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Andrew. I completed my Master's degree at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute and am continuing for my PhD. I work on robust drone autonomy to aid in wildfires and disaster relief (see https://theairlab.org/wildfire). I previously graduated from San Jose State University with a B.S. in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics.

On weekends, I enjoy playing basketball, volleyball, badminton, and tennis. I also love music, from being part of CMU's [C# vocal music organization](https://www.cmucsharp.com/) to friendly improv jams. I'm always on the lookout for my next adventure.
