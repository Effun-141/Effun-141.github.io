Hi, I am Parv! I am a Ph.D. student at the CMU Robotics Institute, advised by Dr. Wenshan Wang and Dr. Sebastian Scherer. I have primarily worked on SLAM, path planning, motion controls, and dynamics. I am currently exploring multi-modal SLAM for both single and multi-robot scenarios. 

I am primarily involved with 
- improving autonomous off-road driving of a full-scale ATV
- enabling autonomous navigation for robots deployed in mass-casualty scenarios as part of the [DARPA Triage Challenge](https://triagechallenge.darpa.mil/index)

I would be excited to hear from you regarding new ideas and collaborations.
