Nathan Litzinger is a second-year master's student in the Electrical and
Computer Engineering department at Carnegie Mellon. He holds a B.S. in computer
engineering from Penn State. Nathan is passionate about learning how things
around him work and solving problems out in the wild--particularly when
electronics and software are involved.

His current work with the AirLab involves reviving an autonomous wheelchair
platform for use in future research projects.

When he's not busy working on the wheelchair, Nathan helps out with the 
[AI Racing Tech](https://www.airacingtech.com/) Indy Autonomous Challenge Team.
Nathan has most recently worked on a framework for learning vehicle dynamics
from logged driving data.
