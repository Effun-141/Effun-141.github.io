Hi, I’m Cherie! I’m a PhD student at the CMU Robotics Institute. I graduated from Harvey Mudd College in 2017, where I worked with Prof. Chris Clark on shark-tracking underwater robots. I was supported by the Croucher Foundation.

My research interest is in the intersection of field robotics, computer vision and machine learning towards the goal of bringing robots to uncertain safety-critical environments. Specifically, I develop robot learning algorithms to enable reliable autonomy in dynamic real-world applications, such as motion capture in forests, high-speed offroad driving, and now autonomous wheelchairs.
