Hello! My name is Conner, I am a first-year MS in Robotics student at Carnegie Mellon University. I graduated from Virginia Tech with a B.S. in Robotics & Automation with a minor in Computer Science. My research interests involve perception and reasoning methods as applied to field robots operating in the real world. Currently, I am working on novel learning-based stereo vision methods using multiple images from fisheye lenses. I hope my future work can help robots see the world better so they can use that information to explore new worlds and help others.

When I'm not working, I enjoy rock climbing, painting, and reading. I love trying new hobbies and going to new places!
