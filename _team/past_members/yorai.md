Hi hello! I'm Yorai.

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu "Robotics Institute Homepage") at Carnegie Mellon University. I graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineer and Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. At MIT, I worked under Nick Roy on problems within SLAM and shape estimation. Today I operate at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and optimization, and work on visual navigation and understanding.

I am interested in developing perception algorithms that work in the real world.
