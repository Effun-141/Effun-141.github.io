Iâ€™m currently a PhD student in Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I work with Prof. Sebastian Scherer and Dr. Guanya Shi, on aerial manipulation.

My research focuses on mobile manipulation, tactile sensing, reinforcement learning and control. Feel free to reach out for collaboration and discussion of research ideas.
