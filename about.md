title: About me 
---

I am a postgraduate in the School of Automation at Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST), majoring in Control Science and Engineering.

I am interested in the field of Multi-Sensors Fusion SLAM and the combination of SLAM and Deep Learning methods.

If you find any mistake in my articles, welcome to contact me by following ways. I will fix it at once. Meanwhile, you can also communicate with me about SLAM, Robots and Control Theory. 

Thank you!
