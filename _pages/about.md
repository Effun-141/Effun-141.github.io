# Biography
Hi &#129303;! I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, advised by [Prof. Ling Pan](https://ling-pan.github.io/). 

I received my Bachelor's degree in computer science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in June 2023, advised by [Prof. Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/) as a member of [APEX Lab](https://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/). Previously, I worked closely with [Dr. Chenjia Bai](https://baichenjia.github.io/) as an intern at Shanghai AI Lab.

# Research Interests
My goal is to develop an intelligent decision-making system that possesses optimality, generalizability, interpretability and robustness. To achieve this, I primarily focus on &#129300;:
* Generalist Reinforcement Learning and its applications in the real world.
* Generative models (e.g., flow and diffusion models) and their applications.
* Large foundation models for reasoning and decision-making.

 &#128522; I am open to any collaboration. 
 
 Feel free to contact me with <u>email</u> (<a href="haoran.he@connect.ust.hk">haoran.he@connect.ust.hk</a>) or <u>wechat</u> (hhr_tinner).
